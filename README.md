****Project 1****:

Zomato User Preference Prediction 

 **Problem Statement**
 
The goal is to analyze and predict user preferences on Zomato based on aggregated restaurant ratings across different countries. By identifying patterns in customer satisfaction, this project helps restaurants tailor their offerings to regional preferences.

**Objective**

Build a predictive model that uses restaurant-level features (such as cuisine, pricing, and delivery options) to understand what influences ratings and votes.

**Dataset Description**

Restaurant ID & Name – Unique identifiers

Country Code, City, Locality, Address – Geographical data

Longitude & Latitude – Coordinates

Cuisines – Types of food offered

Currency – Local transaction currency

Has Table Booking, Has Online Delivery, Is Delivering Now – Availability flags

Price Range – Cost level (1 to 4)

Aggregate Rating –  Target variable

Rating Color, Rating Text – Visual/textual rating labels

Votes – Number of user votes

**Techniques Used**

Data Cleaning & Handling Null Values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Regression Models: Linear, Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, RMSE, MAE

 **Business Value**
 
The model helps Zomato and its restaurant partners understand what drives customer satisfaction and how it differs across countries—improving user experience and strategic planning.



 ******Project 2******:
 
 Employee Mental Health Treatment Prediction 
 
**Problem Statement**

Following a sudden employee loss at XYZ Technical Solutions, the company seeks to predict which employees may require mental health treatment using existing survey data.

**Objective**

Build a classification model to predict whether an employee needs treatment based on workplace policies, demographics, and mental health awareness.

**Dataset Description**

Demographics: Age, Gender, Country, State

Work Attributes: Remote work, Tech company, Self-employed, No. of employees

Mental Health Awareness: Family history, Work interference, Benefits, Resources, Anonymity

Perception Variables: Supervisor support, Interview comfort, Perceived consequences

Target Variable: treatment (Yes/No)

 **Submission Format**
 
csv

ID, treatment

1, Yes

2, No


**Techniques Used**

Categorical Encoding

Missing Value Imputation

Feature Selection

Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

 **Business Value**
 
Helps organizations proactively identify employees who may be struggling with mental health issues and implement targeted wellness programs.

**Project 3**

# 🚦 Smart Signals for a Smarter Bengaluru

A machine learning project to optimize traffic signal durations based on real-time vehicle flow, helping reduce congestion and improve urban mobility in Bengaluru.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict optimal green signal durations at traffic junctions using data science techniques. By analyzing vehicle flow across different times of the day, the system can dynamically adjust signal timing to enhance traffic efficiency.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

A simulated dataset was used, representing traffic at **7 major junctions** in Bengaluru. Each data point includes:
- `timestamp` – 15-minute interval records
- `junction_id` – unique identifier
- `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` – vehicle count per direction
- `signal_duration` – current green light duration

> Additional features: total vehicle count, hour of day, time of day classification

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights uncovered:
- 📈 Traffic peaks during morning and evening hours
- 🕒 Signal durations did not always align with actual traffic volume
- 📊 Distribution and KDE plots showed consistent error margins within ±6 seconds

Visuals include:
- Vehicle flow by hour
- Signal duration trends
- Time-of-day comparison
- Junction-level performance

---

## 🤖 Model Development

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Problem Type:** Regression
- **Features:** Hour of day, vehicle flow from all directions
- **Target:** Signal duration (seconds)
- **Evaluation:**  
  - Mean Absolute Error ~ **5 seconds**
  - Error distribution was centered and balanced

---

## ⚙️ Optimization Use-Case

A dynamic adjustment strategy was proposed:
- **+20% signal duration** during peak hours (morning & evening)
- **−10%** during off-peak times (midday & late evening)

This scenario reduces congestion while optimizing signal operation efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Skills Applied

- Feature engineering  
- EDA & data visualization  
- Regression modeling  
- Urban mobility optimization  
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results

This model proves that real-time traffic data can guide adaptive traffic signal management, leading to better traffic flow and resource utilization in urban cities like Bengaluru.
